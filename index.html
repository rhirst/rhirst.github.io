<h2>
Who Are You?
</h2>
I am Ryan Hirst, a student, gamer, soccer enthusiast, and amateur cook from Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I'm currently majoring in Media & Information with a minor in Computer Science at Michigan State University.<br>
School usually keeps me pretty busy, but the free time I get is usually filled with whatever book I'm currently engrossed in (right now it's The Fall by Albert Camus). 

<h2>
What's Your current Setup?
</h2>
Currently, my enviornemnt of choice has been the CAS lab building's Macs.  I'm what you would call 'in between laptops,' meaning that I'm still trying to fix my 4 year old Dell XPS 17 after an unfortunate incedent involving a cup of coffee and its keyboard.  On the rare occaision that enough of the keys are functioning for me to use it, my preferred editor is notepad++.  I really do appreciate the fancier text editors and all they offer, but something about the simplicity of the enviornment keeps me coming back.<br>
When I'm on the go, or attending lecture I stick with my Surface RT.  I was skeptical at first at the benefit of tablets, but after a few lectures of taking notes on it I'd be damned if I was going to go back to the stone age method of paper and pens.
<h2>
What's Your Dream Setup?
</h2>
I'm a big fan of the multiple monitor setup, having two decent sized screens to work on helps me to stay organized and focused when I've got a lot to do.  As far as the hardware goes, I'm not terribly picky.  As long as it runs everything I need without any hiccups, I'd have no complaints.  That said, I'd absolutely love to be able to have a mobile setup as well: a mac book pro with the full Adobe suite and a battery life that will last me throught the day would be bliss compared to what I'm working on now.
